# Overview:
This Python script connects to a MySQL database, retrieves information about its tables, and generates Java class files based on the table structure. The generated Java classes include private fields for each column in the table, along with getter and setter methods for each field. Additionally, a constructor is generated to initialize the object with the provided values.

## Dependencies:
mysql-connector-python: This script utilizes the mysql.connector module to connect to the MySQL database.

## Configuration:
Make sure to replace the placeholder values for host, user, password, and database in the mysql.connector.connect() function with your actual MySQL database connection details.

## How to Use:

Install the required module using the following command:
  ```plaintext
  pip install mysql-connector-python
  ```
Configure the script by updating the connection details.

Run the script to generate Java class files.


# Note:

Ensure that the MySQL server is running and accessible from the script.
The generated Java classes are saved in the "output" directory. Make sure this directory exists before running the script.
# Caution:

This script automatically overwrites any existing Java class files in the "output" directory with the same names as the database tables.
